This is the code and data for an interactive looking at the impact of the 2015 Nepal earthquake on the material conditions of people living there.

You can see the interactive live [here](https://shijithpk.github.io/demo2/).

The data was taken from [2015 Nepal Earthquake Open Data Portal](https://opendata.klldev.org/#/download).

You can see how the data was analysed in the [ipython notebook](put link here).

Used a modified version of Adam Pearce's [Graph-Scroll.js library](1wheel.github.io/graph-scroll/) to make this interactive.

Apart from the Graph-Scroll.js library, I also used Gregor Aisch's [d3 jetpack library](https://github.com/gka/d3-jetpack).

Based a lot of my code on examples from bl.ocks.org and stackoverflow.com, have mentioned their urls where possible in [index.html](index.html).
